## Serverless Functions

Meet App utilizes serverless functions for backend server logic, authorization, and API integration. When users interact with the app, they authorize via their Gmail account and a serverless function. The users' requests go to serverless functions, which process the data and send it back to the frontend. Additionally, the app's database is integrated with the Google Calendar API, allowing for the storage and management of event information efficiently. This setup ensures the app runs smoothly, scales easily, and reduces unnecessary complexity in managing servers.

## Technical Requirements

- The app is built with React.
- TDD (Test-Driven Development) technique is used for development.
